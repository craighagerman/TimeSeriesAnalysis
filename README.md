### Time Series Analysis ###

A Shiny app for plotting time series analysis of aggregated Twitter sentiment data.

# Background 

A lot of time series analysis is related to finance (i.e. Technical Analysis of securities). This is an attempt to apply Technical Analysis approaches to non-finance data to see whether it produces any meaningful insights. e.g. identifying outliers, anomalies, inflection points, indicators of trend reversal. 

# The Data

The time series data being analysed consists of positive/negative/neutral sentiment Tweets aggregated per day. This was collected based on keyword filters related to ISIL and Trump.
