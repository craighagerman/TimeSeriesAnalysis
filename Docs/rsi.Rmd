## Relative Strength Index

The relative strength index (RSI) is a very popular momentum indicator which compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses. RSI is used in technical analysis to indicate if an asset is overbought or oversold.



## Interpreting RSI
*Above 70* - an asset is getting overvalued and may experience a pullback. 
*Below 30* - an asset is likely to become undervalued
