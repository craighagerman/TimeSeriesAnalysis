## Simple Moving Average

The average value over a sliding window of time. Short-term moving averages respond quickly to changes while longer-term moving averages are slow to react. The crossover points of two such moving average lines are trend and momentum indicators. 


## Exponential Moving Average

Similar to a simple moving average except more weight is given to recent data.ÃŸ


## Interpreting SMA
(1)__asset-MA-crossover__
Plot a single MA line against the underlying pattern.
*cross below a MA line* - beginning of a downward trend
*cross above a MA line* - beginning of an upward trend

(2)__MA-MA-crossover__
Plot two MA lines against the underlying pattern; one short term, one long term. In finance 50/100 or 50/200 is common, but some people use short periods such as 10/20 or 15/30.
*short crosses long MA from below* - a buy signal; upward trend reversal
*short above long MA* - upward trend signal; keep in
*short crosses long MA from above* - a sell signal, downward trend reversal
*long above short* - bearish signal; stay out of the market

(3) __triple-crossover or MA-ribbon__
Draw 3 or more MA lines. Use additional MA lines to validate the signal given by others. e.g. plot 5/10/20 MA lines - the 5-day line cross over the others is taken as the primary signal with the 10-day cross over the 20-day line taken used as confirmation.
